# multiqc-docker-singularity

## Build Docker container for MultiQC and (optionally) convert to Apptainer/Singularity.  

MultiQC is a reporting tool that parses summary statistics from results and log files generated by other bioinformatics tools.  
  
#### Requirements:
Python, Matplotlib, others managed by pip install

  
## Build docker container:  

### 1. For MultiQC installation instructions:  
https://multiqc.info/docs/  


### 2. Build the Docker Image

#### To build image from the command line:  
``` bash
# Assumes current working directory is the top-level multiqc-docker-singularity directory
docker build -t multiqc:1.14 . # tag should match software version
```
* Can do this on [Google shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com)

#### To test this tool from the command line:
``` bash
docker run --rm -it multiqc:1.14 multiqc --help 
```

## Optional: Conversion of Docker image to Singularity  

### 3. Build a Docker image to run Singularity  
(skip if this image is already on your system)  
https://github.com/mattgalbraith/singularity-docker

### 4. Save Docker image as tar and convert to sif (using singularity run from Docker container)  
``` bash
docker images
docker save <IMAGE ID> -o multiqc1.14-docker.tar && gzip multiqc1.14-docker.tar # = IMAGE_ID of multiqc image
docker run -v "$PWD":/data --rm -it singularity:1.1.5 bash -c "singularity build /data/multiqc1.14.sif docker-archive:///data/multiqc1.14-docker.tar.gz"
```
NB: On Apple M1/M2 machines ensure Singularity image is built with x86_64 architecture or sif may get built with arm64  

Next, transfer the multiqc1.14.sif.sif file to the system on which you want to run MultiQC from the Singularity container  

### 5. Test singularity container on (HPC) system with Singularity/Apptainer available  
``` bash
# set up path to the Singularity container
MULTIQC_SIF=path/to/multiqc1.14.sif.sif

# Test that MultiQC can run from Singularity container
singularity run $MULTIQC_SIF multiqc --help # depending on system/version, singularity may be called apptainer
```
